    A SCARY NIGHT
<br>
    It was late at night when I was walking down the street after classes as I had missed my last bus back home. I had to walk back, as I had no other choice. The streets can get quiet creepy at night, especially when you are on your own.
    <br>
    As I was walking, I saw this very mysterious house. You might wonder why I am saying this. Let me tell you why. It was brightly lit even though this house has been vacant for a very long time. I was curious and crept down the concrete path towards the door. The door creaked and opened on its own as I stood by it. I peeked in. It looked as if there were a thousand rooms inside. I wanted to see more. As I stood there and looked, I didn’t know where to start.
    My curiosity got the better of me, and i started with the door closest. The hinges were rusty and they creaked as I opened it. It was really scary…WAIT!!!, ..was there someone in there?. I didn’t dare go further. By then, I felt a chill run down my spine, and felt hands on my shoulder pushing me into the room. I screamed. It was too late. I fell down and heard the door shut behind me. The room plunged into darkness and became very quiet except for my heavy breathing. I tried getting up, but something was holding me down. I cried “help”, but my voice was just not coming out. I managed to get to my feet, and tried to unlock the door, but to no avail. There was a presence in the room but no one was there.
    <br>
    I decided to be brave, and said “hello”, hello”???.. But all I heard was my echo. I was trying to unlock the door when suddenly, I heard this loud screeching voice, I turned… and standing behind me was this dark figure.
    It had piercing red eyes that just looked through me….I screamed and the next thing I knew, it was so close to my face I could smell its breath. It smelled of raw meat, and blood. I managed to turn and tried to run, but my feet couldn’t move. I felt the hands wrap itself around me and it felt so cold….so cold,… that I couldn’t breath. I started gasping for air and tried to free myself from this thing. I cried out in pain as its arms squeezed tighter. I felt its hands on my throat, “Oh help”!, but my voice was gone. I was struggling, trying to get away and must have fainted from all that exhaustion because, next thing I remember, I was waking up and finding myself back outside the house. I ran all the way home and I don’t know how but, I got home.
    <br>
    No one would believe me so this remains with you and me. My warning to you, watch out for house No.1, on Headless Drive……..
    <br>

    The end
